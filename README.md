## foreman_cfssl

A Foreman plugin that uses CFSSL to generate certificates, plus a little management.

### Warning

This plugin stores private keys in clear text in database, so think twice before using a certificate generated by it, or importing existing certificates signed by other certificate authorities. However when importing a certificate you can leave the private key field blank or upload an encrypted version.

If you do want to put valuable certificate keys into the system, consider:

* Secure the CFSSL role in Foreman
* Secure the database Foreman connects
* Be alert about Rails/Foreman vulnerabilities
